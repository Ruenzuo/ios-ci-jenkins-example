Continuous Integration on iOS with Jenkins
=========================================

__Description:__

This is a continuous integration example with an iOS application using xctool as the build system, CocoaPods as the dependency manager, AFNetworking for asynchronous networking inside the iOS app, OCMockito for mock and stub unit testing, OCHamcrest for unit testing matchers, gcovr for test coverage reporting, oclint for static analysis reporting, cloc for software lines of code count reporting, PMD for duplicate code reporting and Jenkins as the continuous integration server. I'll publish the detail setup for all these in my blog very soon.
 
__Building:__

In order to build the application, clone this repo:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Ruenzuo/north-american-ironman.git
```

Then set up the dependencies and open the workspace and you're ready to go:

```sh
$ cd north-american-ironman && pod install && open WeatherApp.xcworkspace
```

__Jenkins Dashboard:__

The main objective here is to have a quality metrics dashboard on Jenkins:  

![test_results](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/test_results.png)

![code_coverage](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/code_coverage.png)

![static_analysis](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/static_analysis.png)

![sloc_count](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/sloc_count.png)

![duplicate_code](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/99114459/duplicate_code.png)

You only need to add an Execute shell step on you Jenkins job like this:

```sh
./Scripts/Pods.sh
./Scripts/Coverage.sh
./Scripts/StaticAnalysis.sh
./Scripts/PMD.sh
./Scripts/Sloccount.sh
./Scripts/TestResults.sh
```

CocoaPods: https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods  
AFNetworking: https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking  
OCMockito: https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito

oclint: https://github.com/oclint/oclint  
cloc: http://cloc.sourceforge.net  
PMD: http://pmd.sourceforge.net  
Jenkins: http://jenkins-ci.org/  

The following Jenkins plugins have been used for the dashboard:  
Test results: Regular Jenkins JUnit test result report plugin  
Code coverage: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin  
Static analysis: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PMD+Plugin  
Sloc count: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SLOCCount+Plugin  
Duplicate code: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DRY+Plugin  

If you examine closely the scripts, this helpers tools have been used:  
reattach-to-user-namespace: https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard  
Objective-C-CPD-Language: https://github.com/jkennedy1980/Objective-C-CPD-Language

__To-Do__

* `[✓]` <del>Make it public.</del>
* `[ ]` Write the blog post.
* `[ ]` Continuous delivery setup: app signing and Testflight integration.
* `[ ]` Currently, I'm executing the unit tests twice, because I'm using two different reporters each time. I think this could be improved.
