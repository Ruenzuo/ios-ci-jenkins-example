Continuous Integration on iOS with Jenkins
=========================================

__Description:__

This is a continuous integration example with an iOS application using xctool as the build system, CocoaPods as the dependency manager, AFNetworking for asynchronous networking inside the iOS app, OCMockito for mock and stub unit testing, OCHamcrest for unit testing matchers, gcovr for test coverage reporting, oclint for static analysis reporting, cloc for software lines of code count reporting, PMD for duplicate code reporting and Jenkins as the continuous integration server. You can find the detail setup and explanations for all these in my [blog](http://ruenzuo.github.io/static-analysis-on-ios-part-i/index.html).
 
__Building:__

In order to build the application, clone this repo:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Ruenzuo/ios-ci-jenkins-example.git
```

Then set up the dependencies and open the workspace and you're ready to go:

```sh
$ cd ios-ci-jenkins-example && pod install && open WeatherApp.xcworkspace
```

__Jenkins Dashboard:__

The main objective here is to have a quality metrics dashboard on Jenkins:  

![test_results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruenzuo/res/master/test_results.png)

![code_coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruenzuo/res/master/code_coverage.png)

![static_analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruenzuo/res/master/static_analysis.png)

![sloc_count](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruenzuo/res/master/sloc_count.png)

![duplicate_code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ruenzuo/res/master/GitHub/duplicate_code.png)

You only need to add an Execute shell step on you Jenkins job like this:

```sh
./Scripts/Pods.sh
./Scripts/Coverage.sh
./Scripts/StaticAnalysis.sh
./Scripts/PMD.sh
./Scripts/Sloccount.sh
./Scripts/TestResults.sh
```

[xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool)  
[CocoaPods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods)  
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)  
[OCMockito](https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito)

[cloc](http://cloc.sourceforge.net)  
[PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net)  
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)  

The following Jenkins plugins have been used for the dashboard:  
Test results: Regular Jenkins JUnit test result report plugin  
[Code coverage](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin)  
[Static analysis](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PMD+Plugin)  
[Sloc count](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SLOCCount+Plugin)  
[Duplicate code](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DRY+Plugin)  

If you examine closely the scripts, this helpers tools have been used:

__To-Do__

* `[✓]` <del>Make it public.</del>
* `[✓]` <del>Write the blog post</del>. It's [here](http://ruenzuo.github.io/static-analysis-on-ios-part-i/index.html).
* `[ ]` Continuous delivery setup: app signing and Testflight integration.
* `[ ]` Currently, I'm executing the unit tests twice, because I'm using two different reporters each time. I think this could be improved.
